üß† Comprehensive Overview
This experiment explores self-explainable models in Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for medical imaging, focusing on generating interpretable latent representations and attention maps without explicit human supervision.
The workflow integrates Grad-CAM visualization and adaptive latent-space learning to make the network‚Äôs reasoning process transparent particularly crucial in medical contexts where interpretability is essential.
‚úèÔ∏è Objective
To design and train a self-supervised model capable of automatically learning feature representations that can visually explain their own decision pathways.
The model utilizes contrastive representation learning and an adaptive attention mechanism to identify critical image regions linked to medical conditions, thereby enabling explainable and trustworthy AI diagnostics.
üìò Code Summary
The provided notebook includes:
‚Ä¢	Dataset loading and preprocessing for medical images (e.g., histopathology slides).
‚Ä¢	Model construction using convolutional backbones and self-supervised representation objectives.
‚Ä¢	Custom Grad-CAM implementation that automatically locates the optimal convolutional layer.
‚Ä¢	Visualization tools for generating explainable attention heatmaps.
‚Ä¢	Evaluation routines comparing interpretability quality versus model confidence.
üìä Results
‚Ä¢	The generated attention maps clearly highlight discriminative tissue regions, offering visual evidence for the model‚Äôs predictions.
‚Ä¢	Grad-CAM outputs demonstrate high correlation between attention peaks and actual pathology zones, confirming explainability fidelity.
‚Ä¢	The adaptive latent organization results in semantic clustering within the feature space samples of similar pathological classes appear grouped, indicating strong representation coherence.
‚Ä¢	Model achieved stable convergence and interpretable outputs with minimal supervision, validating the effectiveness of the self-explainable SSL pipeline.
üìì Key Notes
‚Ä¢	Increasing the number of training epochs enhances clarity of attention heatmaps.
